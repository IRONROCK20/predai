# Predai 

Predai is a NeuralProphet integration for Home Assistant than can be used to predict future values of sensors given the history of that sensor.

It can be linked with Predbat as a possible source of future load prediction.

This is work in progress, if you want to help out please get in touch.

See the documentation https://github.com/springfall2008/predai/blob/main/predai/DOCS.md
